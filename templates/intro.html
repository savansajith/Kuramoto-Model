  Welcome to the Kuramoto Model Simulation website. This platform allows users to explore and visualize the synchronization behavior of Kuramoto oscillators, a mathematical model introduced by Yoshiki Kuramoto in 1975. The Kuramoto model is instrumental in explaining synchronization in systems of connected oscillators, with applications in physics, biology, and engineering.

  Our website provides interactive simulations that demonstrate how individual oscillators, each with its own natural rhythm or frequency, can synchronize their phases over time. Users can adjust parameters such as the coupling strength and the number of oscillators to observe different synchronization patterns and gain insights into the underlying dynamics.

  The development of this website involved implementing numerical algorithms for simulating the Kuramoto model. We have utilized Python for backend computations, leveraging libraries like NumPy for efficient numerical operations and Matplotlib for visualizations. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

  By adjusting the parameters and running simulations, you can explore phenomena such as the transition to synchronization, the effect of coupling strength on oscillator behavior, and the influence of higher-order interactions. Our goal is to provide an educational tool for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to better understand the Kuramoto model and its applications.
