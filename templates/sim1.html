    In this section, you can explore the relationship between the variable \( r_1 \) and the constant \( K_1 \). 
    To generate the plot, you need to provide the following inputs:
</p>
<ol class="content">
    <li><strong>\( K_1 \) start:</strong> This is the initial value of the constant \( K_1 \) from which the range will begin.</li>
    <li><strong>\( K_1 \) end:</strong> This is the final value of the constant \( K_1 \) where the range will end.</li>
    <li><strong>\( K_2 \):</strong> Another constant parameter that is used in the equations governing the relationship.</li>
    <li><strong>\( N \):</strong> The number of iterations or data points to be considered in the simulation.</li>
    <li><strong>\( dk \):</strong> The step increment for \( K_1 \) as it progresses from the start value to the end value.</li>
</ol>
<p class="content">
    Upon submission, the plot will depict how \( r_1 \) varies with \( K_1 \) across the specified range. The x-axis represents the \( K_1 \) values, 
    and the y-axis shows the corresponding \( r_1 \) values. This visualization aids in understanding the sensitivity of \( r_1 \) with respect to changes in \( K_1 \), 
    providing valuable insights into the underlying dynamics.
