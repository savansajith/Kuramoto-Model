    This section allows you to visualize the behavior of the variable \( \theta \) over time. The inputs required for this simulation are:
</p>
<ol class="content">
    <li><strong>\( N \):</strong> The number of data points or iterations in the simulation.</li>
    <li><strong>\( K_1 \):</strong> A constant parameter involved in the equations that influence \( \theta \).</li>
    <li><strong>\( K_2 \):</strong> Another constant parameter used in the relationship governing \( \theta \).</li>
</ol>
<p class="content">
    Once the inputs are provided and the form is submitted, the resulting plot or animation will display how \( \theta \) changes over time. 
    The x-axis represents time \( t \), while the y-axis shows the values of \( \theta \) at each time step. This dynamic visualization is crucial for 
    studying time-dependent changes in \( \theta \), revealing patterns such as periodicity or other temporal behaviors. This section helps in understanding 
    the evolution of \( \theta \) and its response to the given parameters.
</p>
<p class="content">
    By providing these detailed inputs and visualizations, our platform enables a comprehensive analysis of the relationships and behaviors of \( r_1 \) 
    and \( \theta \) in their respective contexts.
